        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          The City of Surrey has opened a project to construct Bolivar Park
          Secondary, a new secondary school that will be on the current land of
          Bolivar Park, Surrey, BC. It will be the only major secondary school
          in the area, and will provide high-quality, accessible education for
          this large part of North Surrey. As one of the few major secondary
          school projects presented to the City of Surrey as of late, various
          building proposals and site selections have been made. A detailed
          analysis of the two major building proposals and the final conclusion
          are shown on this website.
        </p>
        <h2>Site A: Bolivar Park</h2>
        <img

          alt="A Google Earth image of a park"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          Highlighted in red, this potential site for a secondary school has
          been conclusively selected to be the construction site. Bolivar Park
          Secondary, in the below site, has shown to be the most promising
          proposal.
        </p>
        <h2>Site B: 168 Street & 20th Ave Area</h2>
        <img
          src="/images/One-sixty-eight.png"
          alt="A Google Earth image of streets"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          The second major site, the proposed areas are shown highlighted in
          red. Despite showing other promising qualities, ultimately, Bolivar
          Park was chosen over this site from our analysis. The report is linked
          among the other tabs.

        <h1 class="content-title">GEOGRAPHY</h1>
        <h2>Geographical analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The City of Surrey has conducted an analysis of the geographical
          factors concerning the two proposed sites.
        </p>
        <h2>Site A (Bolivar Park) Details</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Address: 13591 Crestview Drive, Surrey BC</li>
          <li>
            Large area with many different activity sites including multiple
            baseball fields, a field house and washroom building, playground,
            and many picnic tables
          </li>
          <li>
            In the south and east part of the park there is a large forested
            area with multiple forest trails
          </li>
          <li>
            Some of these areas offer highly esteemed views of New Westminster
            and the Fraser River
          </li>
          <li>
            Includes a two-acre fenced dog off-leash area - mostly open field
            grass
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          src="images/Bolivar2.png"
          alt="An image of a park"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          Bolivar Park is an extremely large area with a large amount of empty
          space, and large swaths of forested plains. Construction sites are
          optimal in many of these areas geographically.
        </p>
        <h2>Site B (168 Street & 20th Ave Area) Details</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This intersection is unique in that this is the only intersection of
            two roads in the surrounding area
          </li>
          <li>This area is rather sparse in terms of roads</li>
          <li>
            Mostly residential housing, with large farmland plains in between,
            suitable for construction
          </li>
          <li>
            Streets criss-cross to form an extremely large plain in the middle
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          src="images/One-sixty-eight2.png"
          alt="An image of a field"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          This specific area surrounding the intersection of 168 Street & 20th
          Ave is mostly residential area. However, there are large plains that
          are suitable for construction, so there are no major issues in this
          factor.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Both sites feature suitable areas for construction. Geographically,
          both sites are also fairly well-suited for demolition and the
          following processes, so no large concerns arise here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="interviews" style="display: none">
        <h1 class="content-title">ENVIRONMENT</h1>
        <h2>Site A (Bolivar Park) Details</h2>
        <p>
          Cutting a large amount of area out for a school will significantly
          impact the environment surrounding Bolivar Park. Since each park site
          is interconnected tightly, many areas offering a combination of two
          different sites, building a school in this site will completely remove
          large swaths of multiple sites. The only open grasslands are the dog
          park and the large forested area. The forested area will have to be
          cut down in order to build a school here, which will significantly
          impact the views of the surrounding environment and cause damage to
          the forest and nearby nature. Many of the park's amenities are
          connected to each other through the large swath of open land that is
          the dog park, so interfering with the dog park will negatively disrupt
          the environment surrounding the other sites as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Site B (168 Street & 20th Ave Area) Details</h2>
        <p>
          For this site, it will significantly disrupt the amount of trees and
          nature there. The demolition of the natural fields surrounding the
          area will impact the environment. However, for all secondary schools
          and construction projects in general, a positive is that secondary
          schools can ensure that the surrounding area is taken care of (parks,
          fields, trees, etc.)
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the environment risks, hazards, and damages are standard to
          all construction projects, and many of these effects are temporary and
          minimal, having that environmental damages are shown to be minimized
          over a long-term period. The City of Surrey stands by its commitment
          to decrease the environment risks, hazards, and damages for all of its
          construction projects, and its plan for Bolivar Park Secondary is
          outlined below:
        </p>
        <h3>Reduce Noise</h3>
        <p>
          Surrey recognizes that construction noise is a major source of noise
          pollution. Most of this is produced by machinery in site preparation,
          demolition, and landscaping. In residential areas, construction sites
          can often cause complaints or reports from nearby homes. When
          beginning the Bolivar Park Secondary project, Surrey commits to
          adhering to all local construction time restrictions. The City of
          Surrey will also publish a schedule and noise report for those
          affected.
        </p>
        <h3>Efficient Waste Disposal</h3>
        <p>
          In Canada, demolition waste makes up 90% of total debris, and this
          waste is disposed of in landfills or through incineration. The
          construction project commits to salvaging, reusing and recycling
          existing materials,cutting down on materials harming the environment
          Additionally, Hardware, appliances, and fixtures will be largely
          recycled or reused.
        </p>
        <h3>Renewable Technology Innovation</h3>
        <p>
          The City of Surrey uses inflatable water dams, which help combat
          erosion, water runoff, and prevents sedimentation. Sandbags and
          traditional dewatering solutions have proven to be costly and
          time-consuming. New inflatable water dams are reusable and take up
          little space, and are easier to install and environmentally friendly.
        </p>
        The City of Surrey also has expediting construction completion and
        preperation, which will help speed the process.
      </div>
      <div id="quizzes" style="display: none">
        <h1 class="content-title">ECONOMY</h1>
        <p>
          Cnstructing a school on a large, open land will be the most
          economically beneficial plan. In the site of Bolivar Park, Aside from
          the open swaths of dog park or the large forested area, there are the
          large sites such as the baseball fields or the other amenities. These
          will cost significantly as the demolition costs will be higher
          (existing equipment). The City of Surrey already owns the rights to
          the park land, so demolition will not have huge impacts on the cost or
          legal costs. However, cutting out a large site on the intersection of
          168 and 20th street will require a lot of buying up properties, a
          large economic impact. Additionally, secondary school maintenance
          costs are significant, including water, electricity, salary payment,
          renovation costs, etc. Citizen livelihoods also depend on the location
          of their home, so this will be affected if the government pressures
          people in selling their home, only later to realize it was an
          undesirable decision. Because of the above factors, an empty
          construction site will almost certainly be preferred over building
          over existing properties. Adding to the economic impact, a school
          built in any location will attract a huge number of jobs and economic
          opportunities for the businesses nearby. The economical impacts are
          also influenced by how many people live surrounding the chosen site.
          Although more people live near Site B, the existence of another
          secondary school near this site, Grandview Heightse Secondary, reduces
          the economic potential. Overall, the negative economic impacts of
          school construction is outweighed by the economic opportunities and
          employment presented by a large secondary school. The maintainance
          costs are balanced by the overall positive growth from employment and
          contracts.
        </p>
        <h2>Quick Stats</h2>
        <p>
          According to various similar construction projects, the following
          statistics are estimated. The City of Surrey has seven major, ongoing
          school sites currently, so other projects are factored in as well.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Construction of the seven new school buildings on the regional
            economy for the Greater Vancouver Area is estimated to generate a
            total of $258.3 million in sales, 1,944 jobs, $92 million in labor
            income, and $4.5 million in state and local sales and income tax
            revenues over the 30-month span of the construction project.
          </li>
          <li>
            New jobs are estimated to generate $33.2 million in labor income.
            New building construction is also estimated to generate nearly $1.3
            million in state and local sales and income tax revenues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall, more than 1,500 new jobs are expected to arise from
            construction and the secondary school.
          </li>

        <h1 class="content-title">POLITICAL</h1>
        <p>
          Building this secondary school will mean more education, higher
          community satisfaction. There are different political factors for each
          of the two proposed sites.
        </p>
        <h2>Site A (Bolivar Park) Details</h2>
        <p>
          The government will have to get a building permit in or near the park
          in order to construct the school and move on to the other processes.
          Since the government already has many of the rights/permits required
          for the park, this factor will be much easier to streamline and go
          through. However, the construction process itself will be more
          difficult to go through than in a residential area with free space, as
          significant permits will be required in order to excavate and
          construct the already existing park space. The government will have to
          provide an alternative space to important facilities and areas, such
          as the dog park or the washrooms nearby.
        </p>
        <h2>Site B (168 Street & 20th Ave Area) Details</h2>
        <p>
          The field is extremely easy to get a permit for, as empty spaces are
          usually simpler than already existing properties to construct on.
          Other processes follow as above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BC Regional Services building permit process currently is as
          follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <h2>Building Permits may be issued when:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The proposed work substantially conforms with the current building
              code, building bylaw and any other applicable bylaws or zoning
              regulations
            </li>
            <li>All the fees are paid</li>
            <li>The owner has retained a professional engineer if required</li>
            <li>The owner has retained an architect if required</li>
            <li>The owner has retained a BCLS survey if required</li>
            <li>The owner has been granted DP/DVP/BOV if required</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          After all of these processes have been followed, other political
          factors are less immediate.

        <h2>Site B (168 Street & 20th Ave Area) Details</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most important factors in school construction is placement;
          specifically, where to maximize the amount of reach. This is extremely
          important as school constructions are a tedious and expensive process,
          so we want to maximize the output from these schools. There are no
          open fields extremely close to the intersection of 168 and 20th street
          - the nearest one is pictured below.
        </p>
        <img

        />
        <p>
          Note how Grandview Heights Secondary School is only a few blocks away
          from this optimal site. This makes this site almost immediately not
          available for consideration as two extremely close by secondary
          schools are redundant, especially considering the quality and expenses
          of Grandview Secondary. Although this site is not the only proposed
          construction site, it is far too close to another high-quality
          secondary school to consider building such a large-scale project. This
          social factor makes this zone a suboptimal place to construct.
        </p>

          There are no secondary schools in the area. This shows that the money
          and construction invested in the project would best benefit this area,
          of which its large population is not best served without a secondary
          school. Other than the specific site benefits, secondary schools are
          an essential part of a growing community. Surrey's community is
          growing faster than ever, so a secondary school would benefit the
          overall community happiness, education, and social services. Overall,
          if constructed, managed, and maintained properly, the economic and
          political downsides would be outweighed by the strong social and some
          physical factors.

        <h1 class="content-title">CONCLUSION</h1>
        <p class="content-text">
          The City of Surrey's construction of Bolivar Park Secondary has yet to
          have a start date, as the proposals have just been finalized. However,
          our analysis of the two major proposals has brought a clear choice, of
          which that is Bolivar Park. A combination of all of the above factors
          have led to this decision. All five factors are listed below.
        </p>
        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <img
          src="images/Bolivar.png"
          alt="A Google Earth image of a park"
          style="width: 34%"
        />
        <img
          src="images/One-sixty-eight.png"
          alt="A Google Earth image of streets"
          style="width: 25%"
        />
        <p>
          Geographically, both sites were deemed to be in good condition for
          construction. However, slightly more choice was given to Bolivar Park,
          as there is more empty forestry to construct on.
        </p>
        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p>
          Ignoring which site is chosen, the construction process will have an
          environmental impact customary for every construction. The City of
          Surrey has outlined a plan to minimize the environmental risks, as
          shown in the "Environment" tab.
        </p>
        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>
          This factor is independent of which site is chosen, but Bolivar Park
          is more beneficial towards the economy as a site. This is because
          attendance rates will be higher, because of the lack of another
          secondary school around the site.
        </p>
        <h2>Political</h2>
        <p>
          Building permits will be easier to obtain at Bolivar Park, because of
          the inherent government rights to the land. Attached in the
          corresponding tab is the set of steps in order to obtain a permit, for
          reference.
        </p>
        <h2>Social</h2>
        <p>
          Although most factors leading up to this have been fairly close,
          ultimately, the deciding factor is Social. The simple existence of
          another high-quality secondary school near Site B means that the
          construction effort and money would be of a lesser impact compared to
          building a secondary school in a district where there is not another.
          Thus, Bolivar Park is the clear choice for the social factor.

        <h2>Geographical analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The City of Surrey has conducted an analysis of the geographical
          factors concerning the two proposed sites.
        </p>
        <h2>Site A (Bolivar Park) Details</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Address: 13591 Crestview Drive, Surrey BC</li>
          <li>
            Large area with many different activity sites including multiple
            baseball fields, a field house and washroom building, playground,
            and many picnic tables
          </li>
          <li>
            In the south and east part of the park there is a large forested
            area with multiple forest trails
          </li>
          <li>
            Some of these areas offer highly esteemed views of New Westminster
            and the Fraser River
          </li>
          <li>
            Includes a two-acre fenced dog off-leash area - mostly open field
            grass
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          src="images/Bolivar2.png"
          alt="An image of a park"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          Bolivar Park is an extremely large area with a large amount of empty
          space, and large swaths of forested plains. Construction sites are
          optimal in many of these areas geographically.
        </p>
        <h2>Site B (168 Street & 20th Ave Area) Details</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This intersection is unique in that this is the only intersection of
            two roads in the surrounding area
          </li>
          <li>This area is rather sparse in terms of roads</li>
          <li>
            Mostly residential housing, with large farmland plains in between,
            suitable for construction
          </li>
          <li>
            Streets criss-cross to form an extremely large plain in the middle
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          src="./images/One-sixty-eight2.png"
          alt="An image of a field"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          This specific area surrounding the intersection of 168 Street & 20th
          Ave is mostly residential area. However, there are large plains that
          are suitable for construction, so there are no major issues in this
          factor.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Both sites feature suitable areas for construction. Geographically,
          both sites are also fairly well-suited for demolition and the
          following processes, so no large concerns arise here.
